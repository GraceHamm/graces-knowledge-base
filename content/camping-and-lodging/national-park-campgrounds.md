# National Park Campgrounds ‚õ∞Ô∏è

Whether you are visiting Olympic National Park in Washington or Everglades National Park in Florida, there is not shortage of camping. National Parks have ranges of RV & trailer camping to cabins to camping spots marked deep in the mountains of a hiking trial. 

## Types of Campgrounds üèïÔ∏è

- **Front Country Camping**: Your perfect camping spot for those camping in their car or will park their car and use their tent. This is a popular choice for those visiting National Parks. Features include picnic tables, fire pits and restrooms  
- **Back Country Camping**: Have a taste for the wild? Backcountry camping is for you. These are remote areas dedicated to those who want adventure. There are no glamorous features for these camping spots and most spots require permits to camp here. 
- **RV Camping**: To camp with a little more luxury, RV camping allows you to make home wherever your park it, in a designated camping spot of course. Features here include picnic tables, fire pits, electric, water hookups and in some areas, showers!
