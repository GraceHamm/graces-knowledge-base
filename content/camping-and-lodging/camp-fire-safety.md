# Campfire Safety in National Parks  

> â€œOnly you can prevent forrest fires"

These famous words were brought to you by Smokey The Bear and there is nothing more true. Camping also comes with a responsibility to take care of the land around you and its beauty. It is important to know when and where to build a campfire and follow burn bands closely.

## Safety Guidelines  ðŸ‘·
- Check for burn bands at your National Park destination first. 
- Only build campfires in designated areas.  
- Never walk away from your campfire. 
- Always keep water nearby
