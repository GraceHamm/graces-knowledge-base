# Back Country Camping  🌲

Back country camping is *not* for the faint of heart. If you are looking for a true and rugged adventure, this style of camping is for you. While you don't have access to restrooms, showers, or air-conditioning, there is beauty in being in raw nature. 

## Let's Not Forget!  🚨
- **Permits**: Most parks require a back country permit and it's not just open access to anyone, despite these sports being remote. 
- **Navigation Tools**: Due to the remote nature, it is important to keep a map, compass and other navigational gear on you. 
- **Safety**: Being prepared is the best thing you can do. Don't forget bear spray, gear for rain and shine, and temps from 0-99 degrees. 
- **Leave No Trace**: When visiting any outdoor area, leaving no trace behind of your being there is crucial. This is phrase is important and you may have heard it before.
