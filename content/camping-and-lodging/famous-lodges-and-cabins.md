# Famous Lodges and Cabins üè†

There is no judgement here if you prefer a camping experience that is full of amenities a bit more grand than just running water. Explore these famous and historic lodges and cabins at these various National Parks.  

## Lodges ‚òÄÔ∏è
- **Old Faithful Inn**: With 327 rooms, the Old Faithful Inn is an unforgettable experience. Built in 1904 in Yellowstone National Park, this lodge stands as the largest log structure in the world. Just steps away from the infamous Old Faithful Geyser, this is stay is on many bucket-lists. 
- **El Tovar Hotel**: This hotel is located right on the edge of the Grand Canyon. The breath taking views is just one perk of staying at El Tovar, the most lux hotel amongst all of the National Parks. 

## Cabins ‚õ∫
- **Jenny Lake Cabins**: These stand alone cabinets feature room service, horse back riding, and comforts like handmade quilts. I am not sure this is camping...more like glamping with the beautiful views of the Grand Tetons.
- **Zion Lodge Cabins**: Come to Zion National Park and have an amazing stay at the Zion Lodge Cabins. These air-conditions cabins feature private porches, mini-fridges and access to the main lodge beer garden.
